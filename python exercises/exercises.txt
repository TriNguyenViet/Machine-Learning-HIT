HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT 2
( 2 hours recommended )

DEADLINE: 8pm Saturday, May 28th 2019

1. Write code to print out 1 to 100. If the number is a multiple of 3, print out "fizz" instead of the number. If the number is a multiple of 5, print out "buzz". If the number is multiple of 3 and 5, print out "fizzbuzz".

2. Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [[1, 4], [9, 16], [25, 36]]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that contains [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]

3. Given a dictionary my_dict = {'a': 9, 'b': 1, 'c': 12, 'd': 7}. Write code to print out a list of sorted key based on their value. For example, in this case, the code should print out ['b', 'd', 'a', 'c']

4. Take two lists, say for example these two:
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

5. Write a function that accept a string as a single argument and print out whether that string is a palindrome. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.) For example, "abcddcba" is a palindrome, "1221" is also a palindrome.
6. You are given a string and width W. Write code to wrap the string into a paragraph of width W.
